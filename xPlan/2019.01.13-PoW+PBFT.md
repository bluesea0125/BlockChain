# PoW + PBFT
### Secure & Fast
   * Security - Stable, Secure, Consistent
      - Fork-Proof
      - ASIC Resistance
      - Aggresive Mining
      - CryptoGraphy
      - Solution: 
           * Impossible To Control Mining When Based On Open Source & PoW.
           * If Not, Hundreds Of Developers Won't Struggle To Boost the ASIC Resistancy Of PoW.
           * Maybe To Enhance ASIC Resistance Is One & Only Choice.
           * The Another Possible Option Is to Use BootNode.
   * Speed
      - Less Calculation: PBFT, PoS(PoA, PoC,...), Delegated,...
      - Distribution: Sharding
      
# ESTIMATION
### PoW + PBFT Expectation
   * TPS
      - 2000+
      - The Number Of Peers,
      - Geographic Distribution,
      - The Number Of Committee Members
   * Block Time
      - ?
   * Mining
      - Random-Based
      - Difficult Modeling
      
   * Consistency
### MileStones
   * Now ~ 2019.6
      - Release: Stable Version of ProgPoW + PBFT + Modified Cryptography
      - Understanding & Resolving Security Problems: 
        * Understanding Security Leaks & Leak-Proof Design
        * Development Of Alert & Emergency System
   * 2019.6 ~ 2019.12
      - Focus: PoS, PoA, PoC, Sharding...
      - Development: PoX, Sharding
   * 2020 ~
      Possible To Make Something Truely-New
### Plan(Could Be Delayed)
   * January, February
      - Deep Analysis + : 
        * Running, Testing, Analysis - Code & Log
        * P2P Network, Fork Observation
        * TrueChain(PBFT), Ethereum(Ethash, ProgPoW),
        * Cryptography, Authentication
        * PoW, PoS, PBFT, Delegated X, ...
      - BlockChain Ecosystem: 
        * Public Chain, Private Chain, Wallet, Explorer,
        * Virtual Machine, Token, Mining Pool, Applications
      - Design: Design Finished, ProtoType Code Finished                 
      - Development: Low Level Try. The Goal is to Bring Deep-Understanding  & Publish ProtoType
   * March
      - Development & Test: Development Finished
   * April(+ May?)
      - Test: Finished
### Time Consumption
   * Reading Paper- 5%
   * Analyzing Code - 10%
   * Observation(Code & Log While Executed) -30%
   * Designing & Prototyping - 15%
   * Developing - 20% 
   * Testing - 20%
    
# MANAGEMENT
### Development Ecosystem
   * Role Model - Ethereum Developers 
      - Look, Listen & Learn
      - Mimic Their FootSteps.
   * EIP: Inspiration, Problems, Thoughts Are Sharable.
      - GitHub Corporation Account:Though Issues Tab, Immediate Communication Over Problems Is Possible
                                 Between Testing Member & Developers or Between Developers
      - Docker & Cloud
      - Dockers: 
        * Maybe Dockers Could be Perfect for StandAlone-Testing
        * However, Docker & VM Based Testing Is TrustLess.
        * It's Far From Real Network. No Delay, No Fault.
      - Cloud: Geographics Problem Testing, Pseudo Real-World Simulation Possible, SSD-Enabled Miners
   * Human Resource
      - Chain Dev: At Present, At Most 3 Available
### Development Consensus
   * Make a SMART Project
     - Specify Scope & Goal
     - Make It Clear: The Possible & The Impossible At Present
   * Follow The Plan, Be Punctual
   * Tesing, Understanding, Designing Before Coding
     - Do Not Jump To Coding Without Fully-Understanding & Specific Design.
   * Do Not Change The Plan Frequently. Otherwise, You'll Meet Chaos. After All, We Can't Achieve Anything.
   * Well Organized Meeting & Discussing: Synchronization Between Developers, Managers, Testing Members.
### Risks
   * Bad Job Organization
   * Bad Task Management
   * Inconfident, Change The Goal
