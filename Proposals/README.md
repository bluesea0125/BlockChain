# Pow + PBFT
### Secure & Fast
    - Security - Stable, Consistent
      Fork-Proof
      ASIC Resistance
      Aggresive Mining
      CryptoGraphy
      Solution: Impossible To Control Mining When Based On Open Source & PoW.
                If Not, Hundreds Of Developers Won't Struggle To Boost the ASIC Resistancy Of PoW.
                Maybe To Enhance ASIC Resistance Is One & Only Choice.
                The Another Possible Option Is to Restrict The
                USB Encryption Solution Won't Go With Open Source Based Solution.
    - Speed
      Less Calculation: PBFT, PoS(PoA, PoC,...), Delegated,...
      Distribution: Sharding
      
# ESTIMATION
### PoW + PBFT Expectation
    - TPS
    - Mining
      Difficult Modeling
    - Consistency

                                                   Development Of Alert & Emergency System
    - 2019.6 ~ 2019.12
      Focus: PoS, PoA, PoC, Sharding...
      Development: PoS
    - 2020 ~T
      Possible To Make Something Truely-New
### Plan(Could Be Delayed)

                        P2P Network, Fork Observation
                        TrueChain(PBFT), Ethereum(Ethash, ProgPoW),
                        Cryptography, Authentication
                        PoW, PoS, PBFT, Delegated X, ...
      BlockChain Ecosystem: Public Chain, Private Chain, Wallet, Explorer,
                            Virtual Machine, Token, Mining Pool, Applications
      Design: Design Finished, ProtoType Code Finished                 
      Development: Low Level Try. The Goal is to Bring Hard-Understanding  & Publish ProtoType
    - March
      Development & Test: Development Finished
    - April(+ May?)
      Test: Finished
      
# MANAGEMENT
### Development Ecosystem
    - Role Model - Ethereum Developers 
      Look, Listen & Learn
      Mimic Their FootSteps.
    - EIP
      Inspiration, Problems, Thoughts Are Sharable.
    - GitHub Corporation Account
      Though Issues Tab, Immediate Communication Over Problems Is Possible
                         Between Testing Member & Developers or Between Developers
    - Docker & Cloud
      Dockers: Maybe Dockers Could be Perfect for StandAlone-Testing
               However, Docker & VM Based Testing Is TrustLess.
               It's Far From Real Network. No Delay, No Fault.
      Cloud: Geographics Problem Testing, Pseudo Real-World Simulation Possible
    - Developers
      At Present, At Most 3 Available
      
### Development Consensus
    - Make A SMART Project
      Specify Scope & Goal
      Make Clear The Possible & The Impossible At Present
    - Follow The Plan, Be Punctual
    - Tesing, Understanding, Designing Before Coding
      Do Not Jump To Coding Without Fully-Understanding & Specific Design.
    - Do Not Change The Plan Frequently. If Not, Chaos. After All, We Can't Achieve Anything.
    - Well Organized Meeting & Discussing: Synchronization Between Developers, Managers, Testing Members.
### Risks
    - Bad Job Organization, Bad Task Management
    - Inconfident, Change The Goal
    - ...
