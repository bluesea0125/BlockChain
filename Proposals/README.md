### Problem & Solution
    - Securty
      Fork-Proof
      ASIC Resistance
      Aggresive Mining
      Solution: Impossible To Control Mining When It's Open Source Based.
                If Not, Hundreds Of Developers Won't Struggle To Boost the ASIC Resistancy Of PoW.
                Maybe To Enhance ASIC Resistance Is One & Only Option.
    - Speed
      PoW + PBFT
      PoS
### Development Ecosystem
    - EIP
      Inspiration, Problems, Thoughts Are Sharable.
    - GitHub Corporation Account
      Issues, ...
    - Dockers, Cloud
      Dockers: Maybe Dockers Could be Perfect for StandAlone-Testing
               However, Docker & VM Based Testing Is Less Trustable
               It's Far From Real Network. No Delay, No Flaws
      Cloud: Geographics Problem Testing
    - Developers
      Now At Most 3 Available
### MileStones
    - Now ~ 2019.6
      Release: Stable Version of PoW + PBFT
      Understanding & Resolving Security Problems: Understanding Security Leaks & Leak-Proof Design
                                                   Development Of Alert & Emergency
    - 2019.6 ~ 2019.12
      Focus: PoS, PoA, PoC, Sharding...
    - 2020 ~
      Possible To Make Something New
### Plan(Could Be Delayed)
    - January, February
      Deep Analysis + : Including Making It Run & Code Analysis, Log Analysis
                        P2P Network, Fork Observation
                        TrueChain(PBFT), Ethereum(Ethash, ProgPoW),
                        Cryptography, Authentication
                        PoW, PoS, PBFT, Delegated X, ...
      BlockChain Ecosystem: Public Chain, Private Chain, Wallet, Explorer, Virtual Machine, Token, Mining Pool, Applications
      Design: Design Finished, ProtoType Code Finished                 
      Development: Low Level Try. The Goal is to  & Publish ProtoType
    - March
      Development & Test: Development Finished
    - April(+ May?)
      Test: Finished
### Development Consensus
    - Follow The Plan, Be Punctual
    - Tesing & Understanding Before Coding: Do Not Jump To Coding Without Fully-Understanding
    - Do Not Change The Plan Frequently. This Makes Troubles. After All, We Can't Achieve Anything.
### Risks
    - Bad Job Organization, Bad Job Management
    - Inconfident, Change The Goal in the while
    - ...
